Temporary Readme Placeholder

Things I had to google search for in order

- "Thesaurus word for Grid" - so I don't overlap namespaces with CSS Grid
- "Thesaurus word for Image" - so I don't overlap namespaces with images
- "Transparent images free"
- "Optimal ImageMagick compression and resizing"

Time spent

- 1 hr - Initializing React / Scaffolding. Finding transparent image online to add into Airtable
- 1 hr - Compressing and resizing image assets using imagemagick
