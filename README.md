Temporary Readme Placeholder

Things I had to google search for in order

- "Thesaurus word for Grid" - so I don't overlap namespaces with CSS Grid
- "Thesaurus word for Image" - so I don't overlap namespaces with images
- "Transparent images free"
- "Optimal ImageMagick compression and resizing"
- "Process env dotconfig file react"
- "HTML image tag name"

Time spent

- 1 hr - Initializing React / Scaffolding. Finding transparent image online to add into Airtable
- 1 hr - Compressing and resizing image assets using imagemagick
- 1 hr - Writing ths first pull request #1 to connect backend to frontend, and populate images
